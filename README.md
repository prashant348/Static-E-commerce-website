# GreenSpace - Static E-commerce Website 🌿🛍️

**GreenSpace** is a modern and visually appealing static e-commerce website built entirely using **HTML and CSS**.  
It simulates the front-end of a plant-selling e-commerce platform with sections like hero banner, best-selling products, categories, customer reviews, and a detailed footer.

> ⚠️ This is a static UI only — no interactivity or backend integration.
